# REST API
<blockquote>
  think of yourself at sitting at a table at a restaurant in your one piece of software such as a web application on
the client side
and then the kitchen is the server or
the service that processes certain
requests
well the waiter is like an API is
formatted to take a certain order in a
specific way and then bring back a
certain meal this would be the data or
the response that you requested so an
API is basically a messenger or a waiter
between running software
  <blockquote>
  <p>example: login/register using [google, fb, apple,...] and other companies that provide api for authentication
    if you have an gmail(goggle) account you can use that to register in our 
    website which creates your own account in our network 
    </p>
